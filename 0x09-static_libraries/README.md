## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

0. Create the static library libholberton.a containing all the function files. 

If you haven't coded all of the above functions create empty ones with the prototype. Don't forget to push your holberton.h file to your repository. It should at least contain all the prototypes of the above functions.

1. Create a script called create_static_lib.sh that creates a static library called liball.a from all the .c files that are in the current directory.
